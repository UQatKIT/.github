# Uncertainty Quantification Research Group at KIT

Welcome to the GitHub page of the [Uncertainty Quantification group](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/research/uq.php) affiliated with the [Scientific Computing Center](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en) and the [Institute for Applied and Numerical Mathematics](https://www.math.kit.edu/ianm/en) at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/), Germany. 
Here, you can find some of the open-source software developed by our group.

In addition, the UQ group develops teaching material for mathematical modeling under uncertainties using the [UM-Bridge](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/index.html) (the UQ and Model Bridge) interface, which is, for example, used in the context of the [MathSEE Modeling Week](https://github.com/MathSEE-Modeling-Week) at KIT.
