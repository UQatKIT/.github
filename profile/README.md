# Uncertainty Quantification Research Group at KIT

Welcome to the GitHub page of the [Uncertainty Quantification group](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/research/uq.php) affiliated with the [Scientific Computing Center](https://www.scc.kit.edu/en) and the [Institute for Applied and Numerical Mathematics](https://www.math.kit.edu/ianm/en) at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/), Germany. 
Here, you can find some of the open-source software developed by our group.

## UM-Bridge

[UM-Bridge](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/) is a universal interface for interacting with any simulation software from any higer-level code, breaking down complexity and development effort in advanced uncertainty quantification applications. UM-Bridge links tools across languages and frameworks, allows containerization of models, enables straightforward scaling to supercomputers and cloud, and includes the first community library of UQ benchmark problems.
